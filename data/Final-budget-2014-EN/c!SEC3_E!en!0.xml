Heritage, music, film, entertainment, publishing, fashion, design, architecture and crafts, are areas at the intersection of art, technology and business. According to the Commission communication of 26 September 2012 entitled <qt>Promoting cultural and creative sectors for growth and jobs in the EU</qt> (COM (2012) 537 final), the economic contribution of these sectors accounts for 3,3 % of the Union’s GDP and they employ 6,7 million people. Beyond their intrinsic cultural value and their economic weight, these sectors also have a wider ripple effect on economic and social development, by their impact on other sectors, on regional attractiveness or in stimulating creativity and innovation.</p><p lang="en">However, the contribution that the cultural and creative sectors can make to economic and social development in the Union is still not fully recognised.</p><p lang="en">European Parliament noted in its resolution of 12 May 2011 on unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries the necessity of analysing the effects of the activity of cultural and creative industries on the European economy, by <qt>identifying, defining and describing them each in turn, in order to highlight their characteristics, better understand their goals and problems and implement more effective measures.</qt> In the same resolution, the Parliament called on the Commission <qt>to pursue its efforts to produce a better definition of CCI with a view to analysing in depth their impact on long-term growth and international competitiveness and to foster greater recognition of the specific features of the sector.</qt></p><p lang="en">The Union lacks information and indicators to measure the contribution of cultural industries to economic development, which fragments, hinders and discourages initiatives and investments in these sectors. For example, the European Capital of Culture label acts as a catalyst for urban regeneration and territorial attractiveness. However, no comprehensive data are available on the impact of investments made during the labelling. Furthermore, the role of cultural resources and actors at the heart of creative ecosystems, in stimulating economic and social innovation is still poorly understood.</p><list type="dash"><int.li><p lang="en">Information and management systems:</p></int.li><item><p>the development and maintenance under contract of management and information systems,</p></item><item><p lang="en">the acquisition and maintenance of complete (turnkey) information and management systems in the field of administrative management (staff, budget, finance, accounts, etc.),</p></item><item><p>studies, documentation and training linked to those systems and project management,</p></item><item><p lang="en">the acquisition of skills and expertise in the area of information technology for all departments: quality, security, technology, development methodology, information technology management, etc.,</p></item><item><p>technical support for those systems, and the technical work needed to ensure that they operate satisfactorily.</p></item></list><list type="dash"><int.li><p lang="en">Further training and management training:</p></int.li><item><list type="dash"><int.li><p>expenditure on general training designed to improve the skills of the staff and the performance and efficiency of the Commission:</p></int.li><item><p>fees for experts employed to identify training needs, design, develop and hold courses and evaluate and monitor results,</p></item><item><p>fees for consultants in various fields, in particular organisational methods, management, strategy, quality assurance and personnel management,</p></item><item><p>expenditure incurred in designing, holding and evaluating the training organised by the Commission in the form of courses, seminars and conferences (course instructors/speakers and their travel and subsistence expenses, and teaching materials),</p></item><item><p>the cost of attending external training and of joining the relevant professional organisations,</p></item><item><p>expenditure related to the practical aspects of organising such courses and the use of premises and transport and the cost of food and accommodation for the participants of residential courses,</p></item><item><p lang="en">training expenditure related to publications and information, associated Internet sites and the purchase of teaching equipment, subscriptions and licences for distance teaching, books, press and multimedia products,</p></item><item><p lang="en">financing teaching aids.</p></item></list></item></list><p lang="en">Any revenue from the contributions from candidate countries and, if applicable, the Western Balkan potential candidates for participating in Union programmes entered in Item 6 0 3 1 of the statement of revenue may give rise to the provision of additional appropriations in accordance with Article 21(2)(e) to (g) of the Financial Regulation.</p><p lang="en">Revenue from contributions from the EFTA States to the Union’s general costs under Article 82 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area gives rise to the provision of supplementary appropriations to be entered in the budget lines concerned in accordance with the Financial Regulation.

Its production reached 45 000 000 tons in 2009 with Germany (23 %), Italy (16 %), France (12 %), Spain (8,5 %), the United Kingdom (8 %) and Poland (5,5 %) being the top European producers of finished plastic parts. Almost two thirds of the plastic scrap created (1 300 000 tons of plastics) is considered as <qt>final</qt> waste and is either exported to the Far East (essentially China) or landfilled. Recycling 50 % of the current non-recycled plastic scrap would save around 650 000 tons of plastic materials each year. By increasing recycle rates, this preparatory action reaches the target of the Europe 2020 Strategy on resource efficiency. RECAP aims to be a preparatory action for the improvement of internal plastic scrap recycling. It paves the way for the development of new technological solutions to recycle plastic production scrap and for the implementation and structuring of recycling channels based on sustainable solutions and technologies. The project creates competitiveness and employment, extending the lifetime of plastic materials, save crude oil, and make the plastics industry a more responsible industry. A roadmap was established in order to specify the necessary steps to achieve a final sustainable solution: definition of R&amp;D collaborative projects to overcome technological bottlenecks, organisation and structuring of recycling channels, transfer of best practices and technologies towards the community of the Union’s plastic converters, demonstration of recycling technologies through pilot equipment and the creation of companies to exploit the intellectual property rights generated. The results are meant to be duplicated in several Union regions presenting a high density of plastic converting activity.</p><p lang="en">RECAP’s first sub-objective is to carry out a benchmark on internal scrap management in several major Union regions from the plastic converting industry in France, Italy, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Austria and Poland. Each of these regions presents the particularity to concentrate plastic converting activities in a reduced geographical perimeter.</p><p lang="en">From the analysis of the benchmark, RECAP’s second sub-objective is to identify best practices and make recommendations for future actions that will be consolidated into a global methodology for internal scrap management. Several scenarios have been established. Each one was split up into structuring (economical, financial and political organisation of recycling channels) and technological objectives (R&amp;D bottlenecks to be overcome). RECAP’s third sub-objective is to pre-implement a scenario in one of the regions studied within the project.

remaining to be settled from previous years under the preparatory action.</p><p lang="en">Youth unemployment is a major challenge in Europe. Around 5 500 000 young people within the Union are currently unemployed, one in five persons under the age of 25 is out of a job and 15 % leave school without graduating. The decline in youth employment was more pronounced in 2011 and the youth unemployment rate continued to rise in 2012 reaching 45 % in some Member States. This has severe economic and social consequences for society, as well as for individuals. Studies show that people who are unemployed while young are more likely to fall into long-term unemployment later in life and they are more likely to end up in precarious work. It is consequently of the utmost importance that Member States help all young people to find a job or to pursue their education when unemployed, irrespective of their level of education. In this context, the Europe 2020 Strategy sets clear targets for the Member States to reduce the share of early school leavers to 10 % and raise the employment rate to 75 % and addresses these problems by means of the flagship initiative <qt>Youth on the Move</qt> calling upon Member States to provide a so-called <qt>Youth Guarantee</qt> to ensure that all young people are in employment, in further education or that activation measures are taken within four months of leaving school. Youth Guarantee is an important element among the innovative approaches to transition from school to work as reiterated in the Commission communication of 20 December 2011 entitled <qt>Youth Opportunities Initiative</qt> (COM(2011) 933 final).</p><list type="dash"><int.li><p lang="en">Against this backdrop, the objectives of the preparatory action are the following:</p></int.li><item><p lang="en">target young people including those who are neither in education, nor in apprenticeship, nor employed (so-called <qt>NEETs</qt>),</p></item><item><p lang="en">explore how the Youth Guarantee would work in practice in the Member States,</p></item><item><p lang="en">aim at establishing innovative action as regards the transition from unemployment to employment of young people and at spreading this knowledge to all Member States,</p></item><item><p lang="en">ensure a job or further education or activation measures for young people within four months of unemployment.</p></item></list><list type="dash"><int.li><p lang="en">The preparatory action would therefore include the following measures:</p></int.li><item><p lang="en">supporting investigation and collecting the experience of existing projects in Member States where a scheme comparable to the European Youth Guarantee is in force,</p></item><item><p lang="en">based on the best practices collected, launching two or three pilot projects in Member States to establish a Youth Guarantee locally.

Together these serve as drivers of change that operate on the basis of viable business models to further inclusive, socially fairer and environmentally sustainable growth. They also generate jobs through activities that meet social needs in the context of sustainable and inclusive development. The objective of this preparatory action is to identify, develop, promote and disseminate the good practice of national, regional or local governments and of financial intermediaries in assisting young or social entrepreneurs at times of high youth unemployment. As such, the preparatory action will contribute to realising the potential of young and social entrepreneurship, emphasised also in the Annual Growth Survey 2012 and in the Commission communication of 18 April 2012 entitled <qt>Towards a job-rich recovery</qt> (COM(2012) 173 final). The goal is to improve the economic and social situation at local level, and this preparatory action will show ways in which support for young and social entrepreneurship can be most effectively incorporated into regional, urban and/or local development strategies. Special focus will be on the use that could be made, in the 2014-2020 period, of Union financial instruments, in particular the Structural Funds.</p><p lang="en">The main task will be to work together with potential finance providers (in particular managing authorities for structural fund programmes, notably those financed by the ESF), and financial intermediaries, including the EIB Group, in a limited number of pilot regions. This will help develop and establish feasible, suitable and reliable schemes or funds providing equity or mezzanine funding (including venture philanthropy). These can be used to support structures providing business development services and networking facilities, with the aim of stimulating and facilitating the green shoots of development and growth in social enterprises. Actions may include feasibility studies, mutual learning, dissemination of good practice, and targeted assistance to the national or regional authorities, where appropriate. Where relevant, such actions may build on the results of previous actions for capacity-building and mutual learning of regional authorities and financial intermediaries, such as the JESSICA Networking Platform<note><p lang="en"> A learning platform helping national and regional authorities and financial intermediaries develop repayable support schemes for sustainable urban development in the context of the Structural Funds (http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/thefunds/instruments/jessica_network_en.cfm).</p></note>.

Yet high quality recycling in Europe is limited and actually only well developed in a few Member States, therefore a huge potential of recoverable resources is currently neglected. Whereas there is a strong focus in Europe on municipal solid waste (<qt>MSW</qt>), this is only a small fraction of all available waste. Dry mixed wastes such as commercial and industrial waste, bulky household waste and construction and demolition waste (<qt>C&amp;DW</qt>) contain far more resources which can even be easier extracted than materials out of (wet) MSW. Of these types of waste, C&amp;DW is very significant, due to its volume (it comprises one third of all waste in the EU) and the target currently set for it in the waste framework Directive (70 % recycling). </p><p lang="en">Development of C&amp;DW recycling (and indeed of the recycling of any type of waste) follows a certain <qt>generic</qt> path, as shown by the history of well performing countries. This means that general mechanisms for recycling can be identified and best practices can be described. Based on some 30 years of recycling in a few Member States, templates and guidelines should be made available for those Member States where recycling is still in its infancy. It is necessary to stimulate recycling in Europe by the transfer of knowledge and expertise.</p><p lang="en">Important elements of recycling are for instance good control of waste flows and quality assurance. Recycling industry and authorities in a number of Member States have developed tools for this, for instance a system called Tracemat (tracing materials) and quality assurance schemes including environmental testing and certification.</p><p lang="en">The recycling of mixed dry wastes needs to be developed. Valuable materials such as wood and plastics can be recovered and made fit for new use. Recycling plants could also be used to treat MSW if the dry fraction is source separated. Building up such sorting capacity is an option in Member States to find a right balance between recycling and incineration.</p><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">Goal</ft></p><p lang="en">The pilot project aims at boosting recycling in Member States, specifically concerning C&amp;DW and related to that of dry mixed wastes, by implementing efficient transfer of knowledge and expertise. It will also assist Member States in reaching the targets under the waste framework Directive. The key success factor is that the recycling industry itself will be involved. Its experts are acknowledged to be the best carriers of such expertise and knowledge. Specifically the project aims at initiating, on an appropriate basis, recycling of C&amp;DW in three (regions in) Member States. Historical experience will serve as an example for Member States where this type of recycling has not taken off. As for other dry mixed wastes the success cases will be analysed and blueprints for other Member States how to get there will be developed. In one (region in a) Member State such recycling will be initiated. </p><p lang="en">A key issue of the project is to demonstrate the successful implementation of first steps to recycling of C&amp;DW in selected regions in Europe. For this to happen it is required that stakeholders in these regions agree to an implementation plan. This plan describes goals to be achieved and actions to be taken. Those actions for most part will reflect the best practices developed on the basis of experiences in well performing Member States. Stakeholders agree to the actions and parties are assigned to each action. Key issues are the reliable tracing of wastes and quality control of recycled products.</p></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Pilot project within the meaning of Article 54(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).</p></bud-legal></nmc-item></nmc-article></nmc-chapter><nmc-chapter alias="07 AWBL-01" id="314323866@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N1B969" type="awbl"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Administrative support for the Directorate-General for Environment</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts/></bud-data></nmc-chapter><nmc-chapter alias="07 AWBL-02" id="314323867@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N1B977" type="awbl"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Policy strategy and coordination for the Directorate-General for Environment</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts/></bud-data></nmc-chapter></nmc-title><nmc-title alias="08" id="314323870@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N1B9A1"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Research and innovation</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp" tot="tot"><hresources><hresource type="operation" year="n"><figure>1 234</figure></hresource><hresource type="support" year="n"><figure>465</figure></hresource><hresource type="tot" year="n"><figure>1 699</figure></hresource></hresources><epnote><p>Updated title text / Involve women in Science &amp; Research</p></epnote></bud-data><bud-remarks><p lang="en">These remarks apply to all the budget lines in this title.</p><p lang="en">Research and innovation activities under this title will contribute to three main research programmes, i.e. Horizon 2020, Euratom and ITER programme.

Aquaponics is a sustainable food production model, based on the basic principle of organic farming, which combines hydroponics (growing plants in sand, gravel or water) and aquaculture (fish farming). The idea is to combine these two techniques into a single system, so as to reinforce the positive effects of each technique and cancel each other’s negative ones. </p><list type="dash"><int.li><p>The major benefits of aquaponics are: </p></int.li><item><p>water recycling and reuse,</p></item><item><p>high productivity (measured in terms of quantity/space),</p></item><item><p>small environmental footprint.</p></item></list><p>There are several aquaponics production systems to produce plants and fish. All systems operate on the same principles, however, they are extremely flexible in both their opportunities and in their design. The main challenge is to find the right balance between the fish population, the nutrients brought, the bacterial population and food produced. Research and development is needed to further find this right balance.</p><p>Still marginal in Europe, the potential of this culture system has already convinced many countries. Aquaponics is gaining popularity because of its benefits. More and more people are beginning to realise the immense potential of this technique. Entrepreneurs, innovators and producers are getting into aquaponics.</p><p>This food production technique can bring several benefits: strengthen the local food systems, addressing the issue of health and food safety; create employment opportunities, reduce the environmental impact, reduce dependence on imports, provide education and training, to stimulate industry, reducing the carbon footprint.</p><p>The project is fully in line with the aim of the Europe 2020 strategy. It intends to contribute to a sustainable, smart and inclusive growth in Union and international development context. </p><p>The overall objective is to facilitate the emergence of an innovative, resource efficient and more competitive food production system that combines food security and the sustainable use of resources while ensuring environmental protection. </p><p>As part of its efforts to improve food security the Union promotes aquaculture as a means to increase food availability, access to food, jobs and income, including within Horizon 2020. Aquaponics is one of the sustainable ways to achieve this.</p><p>Research and innovation in aquaponics at the Union level will support the development of a new industrial sector, opening prospects for new business, associations of actors in the aquaculture and horticultural sectors and the creation of dynamic short circuits in rural and urban areas. In addition aquaponics can contribute to strengthening and transforming communities (e.g. neighbourhoods, hospitals, prisons, nursing homes) and be a catalyst for social innovation. </p><p>Further research and innovation in this field may enable Europe to play an important role in the global bio-economy.

In this context, the European Union and the African Union should develop a common waste management plan for these materials,</p></item><item><p lang="en">knowledge transfer of innovative recycling technologies: while some solutions would definitely require breakthrough technologies, processes and services, a more urgent priority seems to be the exploitation of existing technologies, knowledge sharing and awareness. Research should encompass the collection, recovery and recycling of valuable materials, including raw materials, from urban and industrial waste streams. African countries need to cope with the waste being shipped for decades in their land and water. European research can help solve some current waste management issues,</p></item><item><p lang="en">economy and jobs creation: investing in greening the waste sector can generate multiple economic and environmental benefits. For example, recycling creates more jobs than it replaces, making it one of the most important sectors in terms of employment creation. EU waste legislation is one of the most innovative and comprehensive of the world. Implementing it fully would result in cost savings of EUR 72 billion per year, an increase of EUR 42 billion per year in the turnover of waste management and recycling and the creation of 400 000 new jobs.</p></item></list></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Pilot project within the meaning of Article 54(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).</p></bud-legal></nmc-item></nmc-article></nmc-chapter><nmc-chapter alias="08 03" id="IDMNcdNLbILJIadMLIX_IGPbcGHfXHJbbHbbLeeIX_Nfbe"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Euratom Programme — Indirect actions</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp" tot="tot"/><bud-remarks><p lang="en">The Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (2014-2018) (<qt>Euratom Programme</qt>) is an integral part of Horizon 2020 — the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.

For this purpose, it is necessary to create new technologies and to reinvent the ways Union citizens can acquire, transfer and co-construct knowledge. Higher education and research are rapidly evolving. Creating new knowledge technologies requires training teachers, students and researchers alike as well as any individual who needs to adapt to new market demands. Given the ever growing flow of data, a capacity is needed to empower Union citizens to access content and to learn anywhere and anytime in an open collaborative learning ecosystem. Many endeavours, such as citizen science, scientific discovery games and Massive Open Online Course (MOOCs), show that — like many other sectors — education and research are rapidly evolving. Europe can only catch up and take the lead provided it invests in the next generation of tools and in the coming generations of individuals willing to reinvent learning, teaching and research tools. </p><p lang="en">The initiative <qt>Opening up education</qt> proposed by the Commission aims at creating the basis for a stronger exploitation of ICT in education. The goal is to make access to education easier and increase efficiencies in learning through sharing and opening content to all individuals. While this initiative aims at making content available, there is still a need for mapping and certifying the knowledge acquired. </p><p lang="en">Given the current youth unemployment that co-exists with a lack of skilled workers in many Members States, the Union clearly lacks an essential component to fill this knowledge gap. The interests and the current knowledge of individuals should be matched not only with the most demanded labour market skills but also with the possible learning roadmaps that can help them acquire the required knowledge and skills. </p><p lang="en">In order to fully exploit the potential of this new type of learning systems for the labour market, methods are needed that are able to validate the quality of their learning. Consequently, a mechanism has to be found that allows individuals to assess their competencies (create their individual knowledge map), the knowledge required on the labour market and the learning path that can link the two, hence providing the right content to each individual. Only by doing so, it can be assured that the right content is available to the right target group of individuals. In order to be able to track the learning path, a validation of the acquired knowledge, possible through online certificates or badges must be made available. </p><p lang="en">This type of social and technological innovations can benefit all citizens regardless of their level of resources, the languages they speak, their age, their health or their cultural capital. Such a project will thus contribute to bridging the knowledge gap and reducing unemployment by helping especially the young currently unemployed to maximize their learning and find new career opportunities.</p></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Pilot project within the meaning of Article 54(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).</p></bud-legal></nmc-item><nmc-item alias="09 04 77 02" id="IDaJKKJaKaKHOHLaIMXKJLGdcLGXHKHePPMLMNdX_Nffd" pp-stage="PP1" pp-status="new"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Pilot project — Connected for health: Wellbeing and Healthcare Solution in an Open Access FTTH-Networks</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts><amount catpol="1.1.PPPA" diff="true" year="n"><figure commpay="comm">1 000 000</figure><figure commpay="pay">500 000</figure></amount></amounts></bud-data><bud-remarks><p lang="en">This pilot project proposal aims at testing wellbeing and healthcare service applications in Open Access FTTH-Networks.

The project aims, for instance, to evaluate patient empowerment and ability of wellbeing and healthcare professionals to share digital patient information. Open Access FTTH-Networks have the potential to carry out a range of eHealth solutions, eg. personal health information management, patient in-home monitoring, sending X-rays from the central hospital to the rural area medical centre, and tele-physiotherapy.</p><p lang="en">The project is to be implemented in rural regions with long distances and with already <ft type="ht">existing</ft> co-operative based FTTH-Networks that operate in a real open access principle. Such network exists for instance in Southern Ostrobothnia. Being distant from the physical service providers and having demographic challenges, rural areas should be especially targeted when providing electronic wellbeing and healthcare solutions in the future.</p><p lang="en">FTTH is the most advanced technology to support specific wellbeing and healthcare service applications with fast symmetric connections and low latencies, notably by providing both high speeds downstream and upstream. Most importantly, open access model enables all service providers to offer their services in the same fibre for free.

Furthermore, the Solvit system is able to produce feedback information by using an online database system which is accessible to all coordination centres and to which citizens and businesses can directly submit their problems.</p><p lang="en">However, Solvit like many other public assistance services relating to Union issues is still not widely known among potential users of the system. At the same time citizens and businesses are often very confused about the right address for their requests for information, assistance or problem solving. To remedy this, the Commission has announced, as part of the single market review, that it will endeavour to create a single web-based access point guiding citizens and businesses to the right service. In October 2010 the Commission launched a new website, Your Europe, which provides citizens and businesses with information, and refers them directly to relevant services such as Solvit in the event that they need help. Your Europe, together with the Europe Direct call centre, represents the single contact point for the Solvit system. The Commission is to inform the competent committee of the European Parliament in a yearly report about the frequency of use of the contact point and possible measures to further improve it.</p><p lang="en">Member States should be urged to take appropriate measures to notify their citizens about the existence of the single contact point. </p><p lang="en">Moreover, in the Commission’s action plan of 8 May 2008 on an integrated approach for providing single market assistance services to citizens and businesses, a range of actions was proposed to increase cooperation between the existing assistance services so that they can offer a better, faster and more streamlined overall service to citizens and businesses.</p><p lang="en">Promotion of all these services also needs to take place in a more coordinated way to avoid citizens and businesses being confused by too many brand names.</p><p lang="en">Additionally, the Commission is to inform the competent committee of the European

The French Government is currently drawing up an application for Mayotte to be granted outermost region status from 2014.

The development of good national/regional research and innovation strategies for smart specialisation (RIS3) is considered essential for sustaining efforts at regional/national level over time. Therefore, the support by the Smart Specialisation Platform established jointly by DGs JRC and REGIO (costing approx. 1.6 M euro per year) to Member States and regions to design and upgrade their RIS3 is essential. This will allow regions/MS from new MS to identify a limited number of areas of good quality research and industrial activities with high innovation potential in their territory that will be further reinforced and developed using European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) to become more excellent and become more competitive in H2020 calls. This will also increase the absorption capacity of New Member States of results generated by leading research and innovation actors in other (often old) Member States in the context of past Framework Programme projects. As a result good RIS3 which are implemented properly will increase the absorption capacity of New Member States of the very large resources to be allocated to innovation by the ESIF.</p><p lang="en">With the resources of the EP pilot project to the Commission, the JRC will sign a new administrative agreement with DG REGIO, to launch a new activity within the Smart Specialisation Platform (S3P) in order to support New Member States and regions to develop and exploit the synergies between H2020 and ESIF, building on and exploiting the synergies with the S3P.</p></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Pilot project within the meaning of Article 54(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).</p></bud-legal></nmc-item><nmc-item alias="13 03 77 14" id="IDbLKNeNdNMdPdOfJMXLfKdHHNJXHKHeKOdPGKeX_Pbd" pa-stage="PA1" pa-status="new"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Preparatory action — A regional strategy for the North Sea Region</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts><amount catpol="1.2.PPPA" diff="true" year="n"><figure commpay="comm">250 000</figure><figure commpay="pay">125 000</figure></amount></amounts></bud-data><bud-remarks><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">North Sea Region as an engine for growth</ft></p><p lang="en">The North Sea Region has the potential to act as an engine for growth in Europe, add value to the European Union and contribute to the objectives of the EU2020 strategy.</p><p lang="en">Whereas the EU has developed a regional strategy for the Baltic Sea area and work has begun on developing strategies for the Atlantic and Arctic regions, such a process has not yet started for the North Sea Region.

Therefore it is very important to strengthen current efforts by direct, professional and tailor made assistance to a Greek region heavily hit by the crisis. </p><p lang="en">Current fragmentation and lack of coordination efforts between central and regional governments does not guarantee that a proper entrepreneurial discovery process will be carried out in Greek regions. Therefore it is crucial to set up a sound and inclusive governance structure with relevant experience and human resources to plan and implement R&amp; D and Innovation measures in one of Greek regions as an example. To facilitate and accelerate the development process, an exchange of expertise with a specialist on economic geography and change processes from other European regions should assist one of the Greek regions in the entrepreneurial discovery process. This help would also lower the burden on human resources of the Greek Authorities who need to build expertise. This expertise needs to be created with the help of best practice exchange on administration and regional economic development with a strong involvement of competent and experienced European specialists in the field of regional economic transformation based on knowledge.</p><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">Scope</ft></p><p lang="en">The aim of this preparatory action is to capture the economic potential in a selected region, and secondly, to explore the possibilities of its innovation potential and its expansion. The Region proposed is one of the poorest in Greece and in the European Union, the Region of Easter Macedonia and Thrace. The Region of Easter Macedonia and Thrace is a Convergence Region strongly hit by the crisis and the fierce competition of low labour cost neighbouring countries. Despite the presence of a University and a Technological Institute and other Research bodies in the Region, the links of the R&amp;D&amp;I activities with the needs of the local entrepreneurs are almost non-existent. The preparatory action should show the example that growth based on innovation and export orientation of the local productive forces is feasible.</p><p lang="en">This should serve as a growth paradigm for other regions of convergence in Greece and in Europe. </p><p lang="en">The funding available from the European Union should support development and implementation of the regional smart specialisation strategy, concentrating in particular on:</p><p lang="en">1) Creating and/or strengthening the links between the Regional outward looking Industry/ Manufacturing with the Greek regional R&amp;D&amp;I bodies (preferably within the same Region but outside the Region as well), </p><p lang="en">2) Supporting Greek regional institutional R&amp;D&amp;I bodies creating/strengthening links with the Regional outward oriented companies in providing concrete solutions to the technological needs of the exporting companies of the Region, </p><p lang="en">3) Stopping the brain drain by fully exploiting available technological equipment in the Technological Institute of the Region and the use of such equipment by local specialised personnel to provide technological solutions for the selected exporting companies and by creating a pool of highly qualified locals in business, trade and exports to assist and advise potential foreign investors,</p><p lang="en">4) Encouraging cooperation between the Managing Authority of the Regional Programme and geographic economists of the Region and other geographic economists successfully implementing a RIS3 policy in a given Region in another European Member State, e.g. Germany.</p><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">Duration — Form of assistance</ft></p><p lang="en">The duration of this preparatory scheme should not exceed one year from its launching and should not exceed the initially allocated funding either. </p><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">Proposal for preparatory action in the Region of Eastern Macedonia — Thrace</ft></p><list type="dash"><int.li><p lang="en">Considering the actions undertaken so far in the Region of Eastern Macedonia — Thrace (R-AMTH) on the <qt>smart specialisation strategy</qt> the launching of pilot action is recommended to help shaping better the smart specialisation strategy of the Region, in particular, the selection of the priorities on which financing should concentrate.

In this context, it is urgent that Union officials assist European cultural stakeholders find new tools to help dissemination of audiovisual content. Digital revolution offers a tremendous opportunity for cross-border online dissemination of content for European stakeholders but this dissemination is often practically slowed down by linguistic borders. By providing new and diverse subtitled versions of selected TV programmes across all Europe, this project aims to assess the impact of linguistic differences on the transnational digital dissemination of audiovisual cultural content. This project includes a scientific evaluation to measure and compare the outreach of content and the audience with and without different languages versions, both in and outside Europe. The project allows a transparent selection of programmes to be supported and gives all European stakeholders the opportunity to use its experience and results. The objective is clearly to develop new business models for European media stakeholders and to enable Union institutions to base future policy initiatives on the outcome.</p></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Pilot project within the meaning of Article 54(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).</p></bud-legal></nmc-item></nmc-article></nmc-chapter><nmc-chapter alias="15 AWBL-01" id="314324267@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N209FC" type="awbl"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Administrative support for the Directorate-General for Education and Culture</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts/></bud-data></nmc-chapter><nmc-chapter alias="15 AWBL-02" id="314324268@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N20A0A" type="awbl"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Policy strategy and coordination for the Directorate-General for Education and Culture</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts/></bud-data></nmc-chapter></nmc-title><nmc-title alias="16" id="314324269@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N20A18"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Communication</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp" tot="tot"><hresources><hresource type="operation" year="n"><figure>638</figure></hresource><hresource type="support" year="n"><figure>460</figure></hresource><hresource type="tot" year="n"><figure>1 098</figure></hresource></hresources></bud-data><nmc-chapter alias="16 01" id="314324270@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N20A50"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Administrative expenditure of the <qt>Communication</qt> policy area</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp" tot="tot"/><nmc-article alias="16 01 01" id="314324271@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N20A5D"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Expenditure related to officials and temporary staff in the <qt>Communication</qt> policy area</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp" tot="tot"/><nmc-item alias="16 01 01 01" id="314324272@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N20A6A"><bud-heading><p>Expenditure related to officials and temporary staff in the <qt>Communication</qt> policy area</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts><amount catpol="5.2.3X" computed="true" year="n"><figure>63 739 815</figure></amount><amount catpol="5.2.3X" year="nm1"><figure>64 377 063</figure></amount><amount catpol="5.2.3X" year="nm2"><figure>61 925 911,93</figure></amount></amounts><relations><relation pp="63 750 856" type="admin" value="XX 01 01 01"/></relations></bud-data></nmc-item></nmc-article><nmc-article alias="16 01 02" id="314324273@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N20A93"><bud-heading><p lang="en">External personnel and other management expenditure in support of the <qt>Communication</qt> policy area</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp" tot="tot"/><nmc-item alias="16 01 02 01" id="314324274@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N20AA0"><bud-heading><p lang="en">External personnel of the Directorate-General for Communication: Headquarters</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts><amount aele="true" catpol="5.2.3X" peco="true" year="n"><figure>6 151 110</figure></amount><amount aele="true" catpol="5.2.3X" peco="true" year="nm1"><figure>6 174 557</figure></amount><amount aele="true" catpol="5.2.3X" peco="true" year="nm2"><figure>8 846 607,14</figure></amount></amounts><relations><relation pp="6 151 110" type="admin" value="XX 01 02 01"/></relations></bud-data></nmc-item><nmc-item alias="16 01 02 03" id="314324275@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N20AC7"><bud-heading><p lang="en">External personnel of the Directorate-General for Communication: Commission Representations</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts><amount catpol="5.2.3X" year="n"><figure>16 421 000</figure></amount><amount catpol="5.2.3X" year="nm1"><figure>16 264 200</figure></amount><amount catpol="5.2.3X" year="nm2"><figure>16 407 004,70</figure></amount></amounts><epnote><p>AM Rapp -

formulate a new narrative on Europe. The task is to qualify and reinterpret the existing narrative of peace through trade across borders — to identify a new vision for the European Union that is not solely about economy and growth, but also about cultural unity (community) and values. The task is also to identify the European values and cultural aspects that unite citizens. This is needed if citizens are to believe in the Union project and if public support is to be strengthened. </p><p lang="en">The group examines what the current perception of Europe is and come up with concrete suggestions on how to create a new identity for Europe containing a new narrative. This narrative should correspond to the history and core values of the Union and describe the cultural aspects that unite citizens in Europe. </p><p lang="en">The process should be administered professionally so as to make sure that the work of the group is carried out in a controlled manner, with the aim of coming up with a charter. </p><list type="dash"><int.li><p lang="en">Aims of the pilot project:</p></int.li><item><p lang="en">to produce a new narrative on Europe founded on the narrative of peace through trade,</p></item><item><p lang="en">to create a narrative which will place Europe in a global context according to the new world order,</p></item><item><p lang="en">to revive the European spirit and bring the Union closer to its citizens,</p></item><item><p lang="en">to show the value of the Union to its citizens,</p></item><item><p lang="en">to identify the cultural values that unite citizens across borders,</p></item><item><p lang="en">to finally formulate this narrative in a charter.</p></item></list><p lang="en">The European Parliament and the Council included in the Union budget for 2013 a pilot project to create a new narrative for Europe.

A permanent committee of eminent persons from the creative, cultural and scientific world assists and advises the Commission in implementing the project.

Furthermore, a corps of ambassadors should be established.

The Council considered <qt>essential that the Community should respond to the expectations of the people of Europe by adopting measures to strengthen and promote its identity and its image both for its citizens and for the rest of the world</qt>. Thirty years later the time has come to assess how Europeans perceive the Union. What is its added value? Why are we together?</p><p lang="en">The initial purpose of the European Union — to secure peace, to spread democracy and to bring prosperity — has been achieved. Today, however, many parts of Europe are in severe crisis, with heated discussions on the purpose of Union membership. The focal point of these discussions often seems to be the burning question: Why are <qt>we</qt> together with <qt>them</qt>?</p><p lang="en">Under Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union, the right for every Union citizen to find his or her own path within the Union should be respected. Therefore, Union action must be linked to an understanding of local values and constitutions. In short, the promise of the Union has to be explained in terms of its added value for countries and citizens. </p><p lang="en">All Member States will have gone through a painstaking decision-making process prior to joining the Union - an emotional process followed by ongoing political discussions about both economic and ethical issues, with most countries involving citizens through referendums on major issues. Following accession, each country’s membership has evolved. This pilot project will describe the relationship of each Member State with the Union to see if there are common perceptions about the Union in the various Member States.</p><p lang="en">This will be done by interviewing citizens from all walks of life in every country. The aim of the interviews will be to understand how the Union is perceived in everyday life by its citizens. These findings will be compiled in a report in order to identify each country’s specific relationship with the Union and thereby gain a clearer picture of the different national perceptions of the Union. These national profiles will then be compared in order to ascertain the extent to which there are shared perceptions of the EU among <qt>real people</qt> in Member States. In short, the question to be answered is: what do people think are the most positive aspects of the Union, both now and for the future? Is there a common perception of the Union rather than 28 different perceptions? And if so, what is that perception? </p><p lang="en">The work of mapping out perceptions of the Union will be closely coordinated with ongoing similar initiatives, such as the pilot project <qt>The New Narrative on Europe</qt>, the <qt>Citizens’ Dialogue</qt> and the initiative <qt>A Soul for Europe</qt>.</p><p lang="en">It is therefore suggested that a start be made with a pilot project, discovering and mapping the perceptions about the Union within at least five Member States, with the aim of outlining common perceptions about the Union, if any, which go beyond the unique relationship that each country has with the Union.</p><list type="dash"><int.li><p lang="en">The results of the Citizens’ Dialogues could serve as a basis for the work of this pilot project.

Union institutions should improve the way they use these ground-breaking tools. Union institutions can use social media networks and online platforms in more innovative ways. Union institutions have no joint communication policy on the use of these tools. Moreover, these tools are still too often used simply to spread a message, whereas they offer the opportunity for conversation between politicians and the people they serve and represent. In contrast to other media (television, radio, newspapers), the internet (and social media in particular) should be used to allow citizens to interact: to provide policy makers with ideas and to start discussion on policy proposals or projects.</p><p lang="en">The Union must adapt to online reality in its communication strategy. The Union must allow its citizens to interact and to contribute. Regrettably Union communication is currently still very much a top-down process which is neither interactive nor in tune with what the new media can do. Although the social network take-up rate (among Europe’s internet users) is about 90%, the Union’s communication strategy does not yet embrace social networks, the internet and mobile services to improve access to information on Union policies or to involve Union citizens. Some Members of Parliament and Commissioners may be using social networks very actively, yet the main Union institutions can do a lot to open up, to include citizens better and to make information available, searchable and shareable. </p><p lang="en"><qt>Share Europe Online</qt> has successfully run as a pilot project since 2012, with positive responses from stakeholders at both the central institutional level and from the national offices implementing the project. </p><p lang="en">The pilot project sought to improve the way in which Union institutions use these new media, focusing on their local offices in Member States. The project introduced the practice of social media community management in European Parliament Information Offices and Commission Representations in order improve the provision of information to citizens online and make EU-related information more accessible. An important objective was to build the offices’ capacity for enhanced activity on social media by upgrading their staff’s skill base through training and coaching by the community managers appointed. </p><p lang="en">The pilot project has helped to narrow the gap in Union institutional communication via social networks in local languages and on local platforms, thanks to increased and more coordinated activity by the offices involved. The provision of EU-related content which is appealing, relevant to the national community and optimised for social sharing is leading to increased levels of interaction. This is fostering dialogue not only between the Union and its citizens, but also between citizens themselves.</p><p lang="en">The reach and influence of the institutions’ activities are increasing thanks to more targeted communication and partnerships with opinion leaders and local actors, including grassroots and civil society organisations, extending the debate on European issues to a much wider public and broadening the European public sphere.</p><p lang="en">Through better insight into the conversations taking place on social media, the institutions are also improving their ability to listen and take stock of the concerns of citizens, who are increasingly organising themselves on these networks. <qt>Share Europe Online</qt> aims to facilitate interaction and access to information, and not to send out opinions about the Union in a top-down manner, which would risk being perceived as propaganda. </p><p lang="en">The budget of the <qt>Share Europe Online</qt> preparatory action should serve to consolidate the positive practice started under the pilot project in order to complete the upgrading of skills and facilitate further organisational change. The aim is to bring the European Parliament Information offices and Commission Representations up to the level of expertise required to take full advantage of the social media so as to foster interaction with citizens.</p><p lang="en">As in the pilot project, the preparatory action should involve people within the Union institutions as well as outside experts, civil society and grassroots organisations. Its implementation should be based on working methods jointly agreed between the Union institutions involved.</p><p lang="en">The rise of social networks has led businesses to create the job of <qt>community manager</qt>. Community managers act as an interface between a company and its clients; they <qt>spread the good word about the company in a language that is specific to social networks, they manage virtual communities and understand and respond to their needs</qt> (http://www.colpis.cat/files/documents/388_material.pdf). With this preparatory action, the <qt>EU community managers</qt> introduced as part of the <qt>Share Europe Online</qt> pilot project could continue to make information about the Union accessible and to represent the various Union institutions and provide independent information about the Union and its proceedings.</p><p lang="en"><qt>Share Europe Online</qt> should integrate parts of existing programmes such as Europe Direct, Euronews, the various web platforms, communication strategies and Union information archives. Furthermore, the preparatory action could continue the work already carried out under the <qt>Share Europe Online</qt> pilot project.</p></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Preparatory action within

This intelligent application shall, answer most questions based on a semantic analysis of the question and of the content available. It shall also offer the possibility of asking further questions, via the Europe Direct service, in the event that the first-line system provides an incomplete reply. Replies via Europe Direct will be given within its established deadlines, in accordance with its quality charter, and in the language of the consumer. The service will be free of charge, except for telecommunications costs. </p><p lang="en">The content will mostly syndicate existing content from the Commission's Your Europe and ECC Network websites so that it is adapted to each national context. In addition to information, it will include an interactive part/module to help solve disputes with traders. This will give consumers some quick tips to help them solve the issue in question by themselves while they are abroad.

At present, the lack of Union and national efforts regarding ASD patients who have reached adulthood and who are first diagnosed in adulthood is having a negative impact on the <qt>Healthy Life Years</qt> and potential for <qt>active ageing</qt> of that specific subpopulation.</p><p lang="en">The creation of a shared European perspective on autism spectrum disorders necessitates the encouragement of advocacy, trans-cultural and cost-effective clinical practices, research, and exchange of information and expertise. The ability of adults with autism to take care, or even provide for themselves depends on their intellectual capacities and their ability to cope with the social and communicative demands of modern society. Patients first diagnosed in adulthood tend to have high intellectual capacities but still fail due to poor social and communicative skills. Specific support relies on the existence of tested protocols in order to detect the ASD symptoms/behavioural patterns that arise not only in severe forms of autism generally diagnosed in childhood but also in milder forms first diagnosed in adulthood. If properly taught social responses and accepted behaviours, autistic adults can function as contributing members of society. Presently, the majority of such high-functioning autistic adults live in a socially isolated manner and rely on social support due to a lack of recognition of the specific form of high-functioning autism affecting them and lack of specific means to support them.</p><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">Aim of the project </ft></p><p lang="en">The objectives of this project should focus on the major issue surrounding ASD in adulthood, namely early detection of high functioning ASD and developments of means to support such people. The strategic objective is the improvement of the quality of life, social and vocational reintegration of individuals affected by ASD and avoidance of social disintegration and early retirement. </p><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">Description of the project </ft></p><p lang="en">The proposed action will build on the progress yielded by the European Autism Information System (EAIS) project (http://www.eais.eu/) through the implementation of the protocols developed. This proposal is particularly focused on applying a public health model to ASD, with work packages on prevalence, screening, diagnosis and intervention.</p><p lang="en">There are three specific objectives to be reached for this project. They are as follows:</p><p lang="en">(1) To estimate the prevalence of ASD in 6 to 9 pilot areas, to be located in different Member States, using the harmonised European Autism Prevalence Protocol developed by the EAIS project, and to validate aforementioned protocol in different languages and cultural settings. This will lead to the first continental study of autism prevalence and will ideally supply the European Commission with an accurate estimate of the number of ASD-afflicted individuals in Europe.</p><p lang="en">(2) To implement and, as much as possible validate a strategy for early identification of ASD in 6 to 9 pilot areas via the utilisation of the harmonised protocol developed by the EAIS project. This is to include a component of translating and adapting autism screening tools into different languages and cultural settings and to compare the results. Furthermore, this objective will aim to increase awareness of autism amongst public and professional communities, and aid in the training of healthcare professionals in order to improve their familiarity with, and ability to recognise ASD in childhood and also high-functioning variants in adulthood.</p><p lang="en">(3) To review current best practices on early intervention, diagnosis and clinical management on ASD, to collaborate with partners in order to review what is currently delivered by their services regarding early intervention for children and adults with ASD, and to identify specific needs and to then design a training program in intervention appropriate for that community and to make recommendations about staff training.</p><p lang="en">At the end of the project period, a clear picture of comparable, population-based prevalence rates in the Member States will exist. Moreover, the medical community will have guidelines on how to recognize ASD at an early stage and low and high-functioning variants, and how best to diagnose and to medically intervene in order to assure best individually possible outcomes. The envisaged multicultural, polylingual experience will provide a unique opportunity for future expansion, both in Europe and worldwide, in order to improve the quality of life of people suffering from ASD. This project will lay a strong focus on disseminating the findings of this holistic public health approach broadly across European member countries, so that the potential benefits may be reaped by as many afflicted individuals and families as possible.</p></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Pilot project within the meaning of Article 54(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).</p></bud-legal></nmc-item><nmc-item alias="17 03 77 09" id="IDfLbbcIIbOfIcILbbXKfNaGPfIXHJbbPMdPfPdX_NfOb" pp-stage="PP2" pp-status="continuation" type="aibl"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Pilot project — Promotion of self-care systems in the Union</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts><amount catpol="3.0.PPPA" diff="true" year="n"><figure commpay="comm">1 000 000</figure><figure commpay="pay">800 000</figure></amount><amount catpol="3.0.PPPA" diff="true" year="nm1"><figure commpay="comm">1 000 000</figure><figure commpay="pay">500 000</figure></amount></amounts><epnote><p>Ongoing PP / Above DB</p></epnote></bud-data><bud-remarks><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">Former Article 17 03 17</ft></p><p lang="en">This appropriation is intended to cover commitments remaining to be settled from previous years under this pilot project.</p><p lang="en">The focus of this project is: the identification of the cost, benefit of self-care oriented healthcare systems in Europe, exchange of best practices, and potential areas for collaboration.

The latter include premature death, stigmatisation, social exclusion, and reduced quality of life. While effective treatments are available, barriers exist in relation to the access to health care, resulting in a significant treatment gap. A European survey completed more than a decade ago indicated that there were insufficient resources and marked disparities in the availability of epilepsy care among Member States, but the situation at present is unknown. Adding to the difficulties in allocation of adequate resources, estimates of the prevalence and cost of epilepsy in Europe vary considerably. A recent review by the European Brain Council estimated that 2,6 million people in Europe have epilepsy whereas a WHO/ ILAE/IBE report estimates that 6 million people in Europe suffer from epilepsy. The true prevalence rate of epilepsy can probably vary somewhat between countries and regions, and possibly also over time. It is unclear, however, if the reasons for the pronounced variability, both between countries and within countries, in reported prevalence rates in Europe is explained by true differences in prevalence, by differences in methodology and lack of reliable data, or by a combination.</p><p lang="en">The burden of epilepsy in Europe is thus a field characterised by considerable knowledge gaps with major un-researched countries and regions, and by conflicting observations in countries where such research has been carried out. There is therefore an urgent need for a more definitive European-wide comprehensive study of the burden of epilepsy and of access to health care using appropriate and standardised methodology. Information derived from this study will be essential for action plans including decisions on allocation of resources for the provision of sustainable, adequate, equal, and cost-effective epilepsy care across Europe. A targeted approach to the delivery of care is especially important for a condition like epilepsy which reports a high burden of disease. Configuring the delivery of health care services to alleviating this burden throughout Europe requires accurate data not only on those needing treatment, on attitudes towards epilepsy in society and on existing barriers for access to health care, but in addition on the economic cost of care.</p><p lang="en">It is expected that a study on this scale will have a major impact on identifying if there are areas in Europe where epilepsy can be definitively assessed as being more prevalent than others. It is hoped that the study will also provide conclusive evidence of the prevalence rate of epilepsy in the Union which would have a major impact on how the disease is viewed in terms of policy decision making. Similarly a cost study would allow for better planning to manage the disease. The study is expected to identify deficiencies in what is currently perceived as fragmented epilepsy care with pronounced differences in resources between Member States and furthermore the need for education of public and health care workers to combat the stigma associated with epilepsy. The proposed unique European study will facilitate a coordinated pan-European action to ensure equal epilepsy care and quality of life for people with epilepsy. It will also demonstrate the need for individual Member States to improve accessibility of epilepsy care, ultimately improving the life of people with epilepsy in Europe and reducing the costs of the disease. </p><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">Aim of the project</ft></p><p lang="en">The aim of the project is to assess the burden of epilepsy as well as the available epilepsy health care in the Union to build a coordinated information platform across Member States involving NGOs, stakeholders and government organisations with regard to the burden of epilepsy. Good practices will be identified and recommendations made for better epilepsy care throughout the Union.</p><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">The strategic objective </ft>is to provide the necessary data for allocation of adequate resources for high-quality epilepsy care equal in all Member States thus closing the treatment gap, preventing the devastating consequences of epilepsy, reducing unemployment, stigma, and isolation, and securing improved quality of life for people with epilepsy, all in line with the recommendations of the European Parliament’s Written Declaration on Epilepsy.</p><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">Description of the project</ft></p><p lang="en">This project would first define a standardised methodology appropriate for the study of the stigma and public attitudes relating to epilepsy and its incidence, prevalence, and cost, and access to and organisation of epilepsy care. The proposed action is a standardised, prospective population-based study carried out in representative regions in 8-12 EU Member States. These will be selected to represent all Union regions, East, West, North, and South, and to include, in the main, countries where no data are available. Some countries where data are available from previous research will also be included to enable validation of the current methodology. Research teams will be established in the participating countries. These will utilise a multi-source methodology searching, in a defined geographical area, relevant hospitals, institutions, general practitioners, EEG-laboratories to ascertain cases meeting the criteria for epilepsy as defined by the International League Against Epilepsy. The aim is to capture all age groups, disease duration, and severity. Direct health-care cost and non-medical costs as well as indirect costs will be determined prospectively over a one year period for each case with epilepsy as well as for matched controls without epilepsy. The analysis will include assessments of stigma, quality of life, employment and access to health care. The local research teams will use validated questionnaires to assess knowledge and attitudes towards epilepsy among the public and health care professionals in their regions as well as survey the regional health organisation for epilepsy care.</p><p lang="en">The results will be used to formulate recommendations to policy makers including methods for follow-up of their implementation and sustainability. </p></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Preparatory action within the meaning of Article 54(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).</p></bud-legal></nmc-item></nmc-article></nmc-chapter><nmc-chapter alias="17 04" id="314324366@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N21C79" type="aibl"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Food and feed safety, animal health, animal welfare and plant health</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp" tot="tot"/><nmc-article alias="17 04 01" id="IDfLbbcIIbOfIcILbbX_NGMOdJIfXHJbbPNfPbHbX_Nfcb" programs-link="FF2020"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Ensuring a higher animal health status and high level of protection of animals in the Union</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts><amount catpol="3.0.8" diff="true" year="n"><figure commpay="comm">180 000 000</figure><figure commpay="pay">4 000 000</figure></amount></amounts></bud-data><bud-remarks><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">New article</ft></p><p lang="en">The Union’s financial assistance helps accelerate the eradication or control of animal diseases by providing funds to supplement national financial resources and contributes to harmonising measures at Union level.

focus on the main farm species and key stakeholders participating in the transport of animals (farmers, specialised transporters, traders, slaughterhouse operators and veterinarians). </p><p lang="en">The final output of the pilot project will be an analysis of the different practices on assessment of the animals in order to bring the best practices to light. Based on this analysis the project will establish standard operating procedures for transporting animals and a strategy to disseminate those procedures among stakeholders including possibly training courses as necessary.</p><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">Animal transport — background information</ft></p><p lang="en">Every year nearly 40 million farmed animals are transported between Member States. This transport of animals is necessary for farms specialised in breeding, rearing, fattening and for slaughterhouses. </p><p lang="en">However, there are a lot of different practices in the Member States, among others because of poor compliance of some requirements with Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport — e.g. conflicting veterinary assessments in animal transport. </p><p lang="en">Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 requires that animals are checked by the competent authority for fitness before they are transported on long journeys between Member States (and with third countries). Also for short or national journeys an assessment of the animal's fitness must be made. </p><p lang="en">A veterinarian/farmer at a farm might assess the animal’s condition and approve the transport. Once the animal has arrived at e.g. the slaughterhouse, the veterinarian then might declare the animal unsuitable for transport. Situations like these are not satisfactory for either the animals or the drivers. </p></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Pilot project within the meaning of Article 54(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).</p></bud-legal></nmc-item><nmc-item alias="17 04 77 04" id="IDbLKNeNdNMdPdOfJMXLfKdHHNJXHKHeKPHNbNfX_KdKL" pp-stage="PP1" pp-status="new"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Pilot project — Farmhouse and Artisan Cheesemakers’ European Network — Project involving the production of European guidelines for proper hygienic practice</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts><amount catpol="2.0.PPPA" diff="true" year="n"><figure commpay="comm">250 000</figure><figure commpay="pay">125 000</figure></amount></amounts></bud-data><bud-remarks><p lang="en">It is extremely important for small cheesemaking to continue and for the sector to expand, in view of the growing consumer demand for high-quality local produce. Small cheesemaking provides jobs and offers a way in to farming — in particular for young people — that does not call for the investment of very large sums of money.</p><p lang="en">Cheesemaking is governed, in the main, by Union rules which apply to farmers and food processing undertakings alike, including very small undertakings. Regrettably, in many cases those rules are applied by national and regional authorities in too rigid a manner, without paying any heed to the principles of adaptability and flexibility clearly established in the relevant legislation. </p><p lang="en">This project accordingly seeks to ensure that proper account is taken of small cheesemakers’ need for flexibility and to secure final validation by the Commission, thus sending out a positive message about Union legislation and the Union in general, not just to farmers and cheesemakers but also to consumers.</p><p lang="en">The HACCP approach seeks to capitalise on experience in order to improve processes and thus ensure that a closer check is kept on food safety. It is an approach that normally draws on quality control resources of the kind only large companies are able to put in place. Under this project, small producers will come together to draw up guidelines for proper hygienic practice as a first step in a response to this need for continuous improvement that will be at least as effective, and in all probability more transparent.</p><p lang="en">One of the project’s aims is to produce guidelines for proper hygienic practice validated by the Commission that can serve as a reference for all those working in this area.</p><p lang="en">The guidelines will therefore be based on how the professionals in the sector actually work, rather than on theory. The fact that they will be drawn up by the 11 trade organisations making up the FACE network, with the assistance of research centres operating in related sectors, will ensure that proper account is taken of traditional know-how in the various regions and that the knowledge and experience of implementing HACCP approaches tailored to small processing facilities that various groups have accumulated over a number of years are pooled and put to good use.</p><p lang="en">This innovative approach, based on self-organisation at European level and the participation of relevant partners, is also in line with the idea of professionals in each sector taking responsibility for health and hygiene issues that is put forward in the relevant legislation, with the legislative authorities setting the ultimate objectives and the professionals making the arrangement required in order to meet those objectives.</p><p lang="en">In view of the various challenges facing it (languages, logistics, organisational requirements, etc.), this ambitious multi-partner project is in need of financial support.</p></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Pilot project within the meaning of Article 54(2) of

Both are related to a fundamental and lasting crisis in governance in all countries of the Horn. In fact the impact of this crisis is felt in the whole of North-East Africa and as well as in Europe. Unless the issues are addressed by the Union and others with a comprehensive perspective, there is no hope for sustainable livelihoods, economic growth and a peaceful and stable region. An Arab Spring scenario in this region, without a long-term vision and long-term investment from the international community to underpin it, will lead nowhere. </p><p lang="en">The proposed pilot project addresses these issues with a two-part strategy, each part building on the other. Both are essential in order to develop long-term, credible alternatives to the Horn’s military dictatorial regimes.</p><p lang="en">(1) Ensure sufficient space for civil society, coupled with strategic investment in genuine civil society actors. Civil society in the Horn of Africa and its diaspora in Africa faces increasing challenges in terms of ability to function and human rights abuses. Government policy in the countries in the Horn is increasingly based on distrust and focused on control and containment rather than support or facilitation of civil society. Authorities in the Horn view civil society as a threat, if not a direct opponent, and do not allow their policies to be complemented, let alone challenged, by civil society. However civil society plays a key part in democratic systems and processes. The tightening environment for civil society therefore needs to be challenged at national and regional level to allow civil society to be part of democratic processes. Civil society actors themselves need to be strengthened to effectively deal with this increasingly difficult environment to operate in as well as deal with future democratic processes.</p><p lang="en">(2) Strengthen youth and youth movements in the Horn of Africa with a view to effectively preparing them for future democratic changes. Young people, both in the Horn and in the diaspora in Africa, are the future for their countries but lack skills and knowledge, as well as life experience in a peaceful and democratic environment. They also lack the means to develop those skills and their governments hardly invest in young people. They are often housed in refugee camps. The displacement and often unclear legal status mean that learning opportunities pass them by. In order to train future leaders and senior government officials and establish genuine democratic processes, external investment in the Horn’s youth is essential. Investment in their skills, tapping effectively into their enthusiasm, dreams and hopes for the future is more strategic than investment in changing the current establishment.</p><p lang="en">This pilot project invests in the following countries: Sudan and South Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia (Somaliland, Puntland) and Djibouti. It will invest at national as well as (sub-)regional level but assumes that a regional approach takes primacy.</p><p>People in the Horn of Africa suffer from the absence of participatory government, stability, democracy and genuine participation. Unless these issues are addressed comprehensively, there is no hope for sustainable livelihoods, economic growth, peace and stability in the region. </p><p>The pilot project aims to contribute to long-term, credible alternatives to military dictatorial regimes in the Horn, by ensuring sufficient space for civil society and strengthening youth and youth movements. </p><p lang="en">Djibouti: The actions proposed by the project are needed because CSOs in Djibouti are underdeveloped and play only a marginal role in the development process of the country. The project could also focus on providing support to reinforce the lack of familiarity of CSOs with participatory processes and the number of increase of implementing partner in the country.</p><p lang="en">Ethiopia: Support to CSOs and to democratisation in Ethiopia is particularly appropriate, given the difficult environment for CSOs at the moment. However, it is recommended that the project is re-designed to focus on the youth component as other components are already covered by other instruments and budget lines (EDF, DCI-CSO/LA thematic programme, EIDHR). The project could also focus on providing support to reinforce the lack of familiarity of CSOs with participatory processes and the number of increase of implementing partner in the country.</p><p lang="en">Eritrea: for Eritrea the support to democratisation and youth is most important. At the same time, one should take into account that the space for CSOs to work in Eritrea is extremely limited.</p><p lang="en">Soudan and South Sudan: Overlap with the geographical programmes is avoided by providing capacity building to different Government structures, in particular the Judiciary, under the governance/rule of law component. Synergies with other instruments, such as EIDHR and the CSO/LA thematic programme of the DCI, should be encouraged.</p><p lang="en">Regional perspective: The regional component of this project is particularly useful, as it is not covered by any existing instrument.</p><p>The project should also formulate complementary activities such as increased capacity building to youth associations and set up of additional networks between targeted organisations in the benefiting countries, as well as to extend the duration of the action in order to ensure the sustainability of the project.</p></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Pilot project within the meaning of Article 54(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).</p></bud-legal></nmc-item><nmc-item alias="21 02 77 16" id="IDbLKNeNdNMdPdOfJMX_MefPeNccXHJffIMMfGMJX_LaGN" pp-stage="PP1" pp-status="new"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Pilot project — Strengthening veterinary services in developing countries</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts><amount catpol="4.0.PPPA" diff="true" year="n"><figure commpay="comm">2 000 000</figure><figure commpay="pay">1 000 000</figure></amount></amounts><epnote><p>New PP</p><p>New PP</p></epnote></bud-data><bud-remarks><p lang="en">Despite collaboration between the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Union on the evaluation of the performance of veterinary services (PVS), on the governance of animal health services and on avian influenza, there is a very urgent need to strengthen and fund veterinary services in developing countries, as explained below.</p><p lang="en">(a) Animal diseases are responsible for a 20 % loss of livestock output globally and a 30 % loss in developing countries.

Additional work is required in neighbouring countries, in developing countries and in transition economies, notably in Sub-Saharan Africa, to prevent and control emerging diseases and to improve biosecurity. This will support the delivery of global public goods and will contribute to ultimately ensuring food security, food safety, public health and poverty alleviation. Enabling good governance of public and private components of veterinary services and better cooperation between them and public health services is key to a better and safer world.</p><p lang="en">Some 125 countries have already benefited from an initial evaluation of the performance of their national veterinary services (PVS evaluation) on the basis of international standards for the quality and evaluation of veterinary services. PVS pathway follow-up actions are part of a continuous process and aim to sustainably improve compliance of veterinary services with international quality standards, and also act as an efficient permanent safeguard for animals, humans and agricultural production throughout the world. These actions need to be implemented in developing countries, notably in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in neighbouring countries in order to monitor the progress made and help strengthen veterinary services and animal health systems on the basis of national needs and priorities (PVS gap analysis).</p><p lang="en">The PVS pathway facilitates and improves the development of appropriate legislation for national animal health systems, early detection, global transparency as regards national sanitary status through the notification of animal diseases including zoonoses, rapid response to outbreaks, biosecurity measures, compensation for farmers in the event of compulsory slaughter, vaccination (if necessary) and capacity-building for and cooperation between the public and private sectors (notably farmers, pastoralists, and private veterinarians), as well as guarantees that quality drugs are used.</p><p lang="en">Unfortunately, PVS evaluations completed to date have demonstrated worrying weaknesses and major shortcomings in more than 100 countries. This situation threatens early detection and global transparency as regards national sanitary status and zoonoses and increases dramatically the global cost on fighting pandemics and animal diseases, with disastrous effects on the billion people directly dependent on livestock. </p></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Pilot project within the meaning of Article 54(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).</p></bud-legal></nmc-item><nmc-item alias="21 02 77 17" id="IDbLKNeNdNMdPdOfJMX_LOcLJHccXHKHPcaLedJdXNKOH" pp-stage="PP1" pp-status="new"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Pilot project — Corporate Social Responsibility and access to voluntary family planning for factory workers in developing countries</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts><amount catpol="4.0.PPPA" diff="true" year="n"><figure commpay="comm">750 000</figure><figure commpay="pay">375 000</figure></amount></amounts><epnote><p>New PP</p><p>New PP</p></epnote></bud-data><bud-remarks><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">Objectives</ft></p><p lang="en">This appropriation is intended to fund the establishment of a Europe wide network bringing together MNCs with activities in developing countries and headquarters in Europe and organisations providing family planning services.

Although the post-crisis situations in these two countries are quite different, the root causes of low health indicators are similar: large rural areas, sociocultural barriers, inadequate health infrastructure, lack of health competencies and capacities notably on the number of medical professionals, and the low retention rate of skilled medical staff. While these challenges are common across Sub-Saharan Africa, the largely nomadic population in the target area of this project have additional needs that are currently not met by the health system. Indeed the health system often fails to address the mobile nature of these pastoralist groups. This results in increased vulnerability of these groups which is already affected by a lack of adequate nutrition, gender inequalities, maternal and child mortality rates and low access to quality of healthcare services and information.</p><p lang="en">The parallel post-crisis situation in these two regions would help drawing lessons learnt and best practices on resilience and linking relief, rehabilitation and development (LRRD) that would be highly relevant for the Union in the framework of the AGIR initiative, and best practices from this pilot project could be replicated within this and other initiatives. </p><p lang="en">Using the health sector as an example with particular emphasis on sexual and reproductive health, the preparatory action will aim to establish baselines, draw operational recommendations on resilience and LRRD and capitalise on them to impulse reinforcing health capacities of communities as regard the needs of nomadic groups in the context of post-crisis in Mali and Niger. </p><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">Objectives</ft></p><p lang="en">The overall objective of the project is to build capacity of health workers to provide quality services targeted to the specific needs of nomadic groups (in a post-crisis situation), with a particular emphasis on sexual and reproductive health.

This will done in partnership of training facilities as well as local and national authorities. The training will include the full range of basic health care and prevention including the reference of pregnant women to health centres. It will also contain training on the collection and monitoring of data on health status of nomadic groups.

formulate and follow up coordination measures under its development policy. Policy coordination is crucial to the consistency, complementarity and aid and development effectiveness.</p><p lang="en">Coordination measures are essential in defining and shaping the Union development policy at a strategic and programming level. The specific nature of the Union development policy is directly enshrined in the Treaties (Articles 208 and 210 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). Union aid and the national policies of the Member States in the sphere of development cooperation need to complement and reinforce each other and this cannot work without coordination. Article 210 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union calls on the Commission to act as coordinator of the Member States’ and the Union’s development policies and of action in development cooperation. </p><p lang="en">Coordination is not only a major factor in the Commission’s value added vis-à-vis the policies of the Member States but also a priority in the work schedule at the point where the agendas of the Union and the international community intersect. It therefore reflects a steadily growing demand from the other European institutions, as recognised by the Member States and by the European Parliament at the European Council in Barcelona in March 2002.</p><p>This appropriation covers various forms of action:</p><list type="dash"><int.li><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">Action A: Coordination at European and international levels:</ft></p></int.li><item><p lang="en">effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, impact and viability studies in the area of coordination, meetings of experts and exchanges between the Commission, Member States, and other international actors (US, emerging donors, etc.) and international forums such as South-South cooperation,</p></item><item><p lang="en">monitoring of policies and operations in the course of implementation,</p></item><item><p lang="en">support measures to improve the quality of the monitoring of ongoing operations and the preparation of future operations,</p></item><item><p lang="en">measures to support external initiatives in the sphere of coordination,</p></item><item><p lang="en">the preparation of common positions, statements and initiatives,</p></item><item><p lang="en">the organisation of events relating to coordination,</p></item><item><p lang="en">the Commission’s membership fees to the international organisations and networks,</p></item><item><p lang="en">the dissemination of information through the production of publications and the development of information systems.</p></item></list><p lang="en">This appropriation will also cover the financing of the initiative entitled <qt>Mobilising European Research on Development Policies</qt> which aims to provide added value to the Union policymaking process on development issues by improving the quality and forward-looking perspective of Union policy formulation. The initiative seeks to enhance synergies between European researchers and policymakers by bringing them together in one common project. The main output of this initiative is the publication, on an annual basis, of a <qt>European Report on Development</qt> (ERD). The ERD, together with other intermediary products (background papers, seminars and workshops), will play a catalytic role in strengthening and refining the European perspective on key development challenges and its influence on the international development agenda on the basis of independent knowledge excellence and innovative policy recommendations. This initiative is financed jointly by the Commission and Member States through contributions on a voluntary basis. In addition, the appropriation will finance the publication of the ERD, including its translation, printing, dissemination and a promotional campaign to disseminate the policy recommendations of the ERD to development actors.</p><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">Action B: Raising awareness</ft></p><list type="dash"><int.li><p lang="en">This appropriation covers the financing of activities designed to draw attention to action by the Union and the Member States in the development field and to raise public awareness of development issues.

In this respect the Commission may co-finance, as in previous European Years, awareness-raising activities with Member States, in particular aiming at those countries where development cooperation (as a donor) does not have a long established tradition, and with civil society organisations. This European Year should lead to additional activities to be financed within Europe and in third countries in the context of the international process deciding on and launching the global post 2015 development framework which will replace the Millennium Development Goals. Every activity financed pursuant to this action must include the following two components, which are complementary in the Commission’s view:</p></int.li><item><p lang="en">an <qt>information</qt> component, designed to promote the various activities which the Union undertakes in the development aid field and the activities which it conducts in partnership with the Member States and other international institutions,</p></item><item><p lang="en">an <qt>awareness-raising</qt> component, covering public opinion in the Union, and in developing countries.</p></item></list><p lang="en">These activities consist mainly, though not exclusively, of financial support for schemes in the audiovisual, publications, seminars and events fields as applied to development, the production of information material, the development of information systems, and also the Lorenzo Natali prize for journalism in the development field.</p><p lang="en">These activities are directed at public and private sector partners, and at the Union’s representations and delegations in the Member States.</p><p lang="en">This appropriation is moreover intended to cover the funding of priority information and communication activities directed towards the citizens of the Union and dealing with the Union’s external policies as a whole.</p><list type="dash"><int.li><p lang="en">The areas which will be covered by information activities include those below, but may embrace other aspects of the Union’s external relations, particularly in relation to the future of the Union’s external policy:</p></int.li><item><p lang="en">addressing the weak public perception of external assistance.

To be politically effective, the various objectives stated in the Charter need to be defined in terms of relevant indicators, that are specifically and clearly measurable, thorough and comprehensive, realistic and modifiable, and that allow the current state of implementation to be benchmarked against the objectives of the Charter. The pilot project should finance actions geared towards the development of such indicators so as to assess implementation of the Charter (similar to the Union’s follow-up to the UN Beijing process). In cooperation with local authorities, the European Institute for Gender Equality could be involved because of its expertise in developing indicators. The pilot project should last for two years, with a total budget of EUR 1 million, and enable local actors to better monitor implementation of the Charter.</p></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Pilot project within the meaning of Article 54(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).</p></bud-legal></nmc-item><nmc-item alias="33 02 77 07" id="IDfLbbcIIbOfIcILbbX_LdaIaGfaXHJbbeKGddLbX_NPPf" pp-stage="PP2" pp-status="continuation" type="aibl"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Pilot project — European Union Real Time Sign Language Application and Service</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts><amount catpol="3.0.PPPA" diff="true" year="n"><figure commpay="comm">p.m.</figure><figure commpay="pay">319 000</figure></amount><amount catpol="3.0.PPPA" diff="true" year="nm1"><figure commpay="comm">750 000</figure><figure commpay="pay">375 000</figure></amount></amounts></bud-data><bud-remarks><p lang="en"><ft type="ht">Former Article 16 04 05</ft></p><p lang="en">This appropriation is intended to cover commitments remaining to be settled from previous years under the pilot project.</p><p lang="en">The goal of this project is to develop a service concept and later a technology platform and service that can be used by any deaf or hard-of-hearing citizen within the Union to assist them with real-time live sign language interpretation by a certified sign language interpreter or a real-time captioning service (financed by the respective Member State or Union institution) in order to enable independent communication with the Union institutions, such as the European Parliament or the Commission.

The Union, if the contributions of its Member States are also taken into account, is the biggest funding partner for this programme.</p><p lang="en">Early evaluations suggest that the lack of common methodologies and sufficient resources (human, technical and financial) to forecast, measure, report, verify and compare (FMRVC) forest emissions over time and between countries are a major weak point of REDD+.</p><p lang="en">This pilot project will use existing roads and expansion of accessibility, through the opening of new roads, as an early performance indicator for projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and to strengthen Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT). At the same time the pilot project will incorporate information on accessibility (e.g. road networks) into harmonised FMRVC methodologies as a way of improving the efficiency and reliability of REDD+ reporting, thus laying the groundwork for the post-2020 climate regime to be agreed at UNFCCC COP-21 in Paris in December 2015.</p><p lang="en">In tropical areas, satellite and land-based data indicate that the opening of a new road through a forest is generally followed by the building of secondary roads (paved or unpaved) that will then trigger more degradation and deforestation (conversion to agriculture or ranching). Scientific reports agree that most deforestation, fragmentation and forest degradation occurs in a <qt>risk zone</qt> around infrastructure and access networks.</p><p lang="en">Therefore, building new roads is not only a major driver of deforestation and forest degradation; it can also be a cost-efficient indicator of likely forest emissions and biodiversity loss. Maps of roadless areas can be created from spatial information on infrastructure, including roads, and then overlapped with up-to-date forest maps to make an early assessment of the impact of Union sectoral policies and the efficiency of the REDD+ activities supported. This could also help meet a strategic Union target stemming from the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, namely that, by 2020, the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, should be at least halved and, where feasible, brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation significantly reduced.</p><p lang="en">Assessing the impact of accessibility expansion can help in measuring performance in the five activities encompassed by REDD+ (deforestation, forest degradation, conservation, management, and enhancement of forest carbon stock). Additionally, road planning is an easily understandable strategic tool that can be used by both donors and beneficiaries of the REDD+ scheme, and it ties in with the international drivers of deforestation (including imports in the Union).</p><list type="dash"><int.li><p lang="en">This appropriation should help deliver and cover the cost of:</p></int.li><item><p lang="en">producing an up-to-date global map of roadless areas in forested regions, focusing on tropical forests (based on best available spatial data and satellite images); these maps should be made publicly available on a dedicated website,</p></item><item><p lang="en">developing a prediction model for deforestation and forest degradation on the basis of existing roads and road-building forecasts in priority areas,</p></item><item><p lang="en">compiling a brochure on the impact of Union sectoral policies (e.g. infrastructure, agriculture and mining) on tropical deforestation and forest degradation,</p></item><item><p lang="en">presenting the above deliverables in workshops and symposiums (in particular as side events during the UNFCCC and CBD COPs) and disseminating the relevant material.</p></item></list></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Pilot project within the meaning of Article 54(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).</p></bud-legal></nmc-item></nmc-article></nmc-chapter><nmc-chapter alias="34 AWBL-01" id="IDfLbbcIIbOfIcILbbXIINGaPMHXHJbaedJNLfJX_NOfL" type="awbl"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Administrative support for the Directorate-General for Climate Action</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts/></bud-data></nmc-chapter><nmc-chapter alias="34 AWBL-02" id="IDfLbbcIIbOfIcILbbXIINGaPMHXHJbaedJNLfJX_NOfK" type="awbl"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Policy strategy and coordination for the Directorate-General for Climate Action</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp"><amounts/></bud-data></nmc-chapter></nmc-title><nmc-title alias="40" id="314325046@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N29013"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Reserves</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp" tot="tot"/><nmc-chapter alias="40 01" id="314325047@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N2901D"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Reserves for administrative expenditure</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp" tot="tot"/><nmc-article alias="40 01 40" id="314325048@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N29027"><bud-heading><p>Administrative reserve</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp" type="reserve"><amounts><amount year="n"><figure>p.m.</figure></amount><amount year="nm1"><figure>6 829 200</figure></amount><amount year="nm2"><figure>0,—</figure></amount></amounts></bud-data><bud-remarks><p lang="en">The appropriations entered in this article are purely provisional and may only be used after their transfer to another budget line in accordance with the Financial Regulation.</p><table/></bud-remarks><bud-legal><p lang="en">Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).</p></bud-legal></nmc-article><nmc-article alias="40 01 42" id="314325049@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N29058"><bud-heading><p>Contingency reserve</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp" type="reserve"><amounts><amount catpol="5.2.3X" year="n"><figure>p.m.</figure></amount><amount catpol="5.2.3X" year="nm1"><figure>p.m.</figure></amount><amount catpol="5.2.3X" year="nm2"><figure>0,—</figure></amount></amounts></bud-data></nmc-article></nmc-chapter><nmc-chapter alias="40 02" id="314325050@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N2906B"><bud-heading><p lang="en">Reserves for financial interventions</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp" tot="tot"/><nmc-article alias="40 02 40" id="314325051@dd2a8986-adea-456d-b71b-b3c9bb23dabe-N29075"><bud-heading><p>Non-differentiated appropriations</p></bud-heading><bud-data exprev="exp" type="reserve"><amounts><amount year="n"><figure>p.m.</figure></amount><amount year="nm1"><figure>p.m.</figure></amount><amount year="nm2"><figure>0,—</figure></amount></amounts></bud-data><bud-remarks><p lang="en">The appropriations in the Title <qt>Reserves</qt> are intended for two circumstances only: (a) where no basic act exists for the action concerned when the budget is established; and (b) where there are serious grounds for doubting the adequacy of the appropriations or the possibility of implementing, under conditions consonant with sound financial management, the appropriations entered in the lines concerned.
